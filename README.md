# Etch_a_sketch

Unfortunately I wrote this project a while ago and I didn't create README files back then.
Ow how I have grown haha.

Check out [my website](https://www.joshuawootonn.com) if you want to see it in action. It is in my portfolio!

This project is part of [TheOdinProject's](http://www.theodinproject.com) Ruby track.
The project itself can be seen [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/javascript-and-jquery)!
